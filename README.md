# Techdegree-Project3

In this project I used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, I added JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

-adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
-validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
